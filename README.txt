The source code .java file is in the src folder and .class file all in the bin folder.

Each folder named ¡°Peer1¡± to ¡°Peer5¡° is used for store chunks, summary file and the final file. you can see the summary file in txt format and after download all chunks, the final file will be builded with the name ¡°test.pdf¡±.

The configuration folder is use for store configuration file in txt format. The configuration file assgined different port number for different peer which will used by each peer.

In the test folder is the test pdf file, I choose a pdf file with 1.9MB. But it also can be changed into other files with the same name ¡°test.pdf¡±.  

When you run the command , please at first do ¡°cd P2P/¡± and ¡°cd bin/¡± to get into the bin  folder and then do ¡±java Server¡± or ¡°java Peer3¡± command to run the content, careful about the uppercase and lowercase of letter.

If any problem with my P2P application program, feel free to contact me.
